By performing tasks remotely and without the need for physical presence, AR contributes to improved work-life balance for technicians, saving time and energy spent on commuting.","Fully integrated AR systems autonomously adjust to the maintenance environment in real-time, ensuring that technicians can perform repairs without needing to travel to the factory. This reduces commuting and enhances work-life balance by enabling technicians to access expert support remotely and complete their tasks efficiently from any location."
Ethical culture & behavior,MES (manufacturing execution system),"MES enables the logging of safety incidents and near-misses directly from the shop floor, offering transparency and initial documentation of safety issues, helping promote a culture of safety and accountability","MES analyzes reported incidents and near-misses, helping identify recurring safety issues or problematic areas, allowing managers to diagnose and address underlying safety risks to improve overall workplace safety.","MES leverages predictive analytics to forecast high-risk areas or potential incidents based on historical safety data, enabling managers to take proactive measures and mitigate safety risks before they escalate.","MES generates recommendations for safety improvements and process changes based on the analysis of reported incidents, guiding management on how to reduce workplace hazards and improve safety protocols.","MES autonomously reacts to safety incidents or near-misses in real time, triggering alerts or stopping production to prevent accidents, ensuring immediate response to risks, while maintaining transparency and ethical behavior."
Ethical culture & behavior,HMI (human-machine interface),"HMI systems enable operators to easily report safety issues in real-time, improving hazard identification and ensuring quick communication of unsafe conditions, thereby supporting a safer workplace and reducing the risk of accidents or environmental harm.","HMI systems analyze reported safety incidents to identify recurring hazards or unsafe conditions, helping prioritize areas for improvement and enabling a safer environment, which ultimately reduces safety-related incidents and the impact on workers' health and safety.","HMI systems predict future safety risks by analyzing trends in reported hazards, providing proactive alerts to prevent accidents before they occur, enhancing workplace safety and contributing to a more sustainable working environment. ","HMI systems recommend process improvements or corrective actions based on reported hazards, helping to reduce the occurrence of unsafe conditions and improve overall safety, which reduces risk to workers and supports a healthier, safer workplace.",N/A
